\title{calculate total road length within each hexagon of the grid}
\usage{
calculate_rds_by_grid(grid, rds)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{(sf object) output of radius_hex_grid}

\item{rds}{(sf object) osm roads sf object}
}
\value{
vector of total road length in meters that is the same length as the number of rows in the grid sf object
}
\description{
takes the result of radius_hex_grid and extract_osm_rds to sum the length of road segments in meters within each hexagon of the grid
}
\examples{
# calculate the summed length of road segments per each 1km hexagon in the grid
rd_lens<-uRbano::calculate_rds_by_grid(Rgrid, rds)
# add column for road length to the hex grid
Rgrid<-Rgrid \%>\% mutate(rd_lens=rd_lens)
